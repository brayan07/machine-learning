In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. GaussianNB \n",
    "\n",
    "    One of the most well known applications of Naive Bayes is spam filtering.  Although Naive Bayes had been used for the purpose of spam filtering in academic circles before, it wasn't until the summer of 2002 when Paul Graham wrote about his success using Naive Bayes that the idea gained traction in industry.  By 2003, Graham had demonstrated that he could achieve false positive rates as low as 0.03%.<sup>1</sup>  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Naive Bayes is efficient for training because it requires the calculation only of v\\*n parameters, where n is the number of attributes, and v is the number of classification categories that V, the label, can take.<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Potential weaknesses in this model stem from its assumption of conditional independence among the attributes in the data.  This makes naive bayes particularly ill suited for cases when there is a strong deviation from conditoinal independence, such as is in the case of XOR.<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I chose GaussianNB for one of my models because it serves as a good standard by which to measure potential improvements offered by more sophisticated models.  Although one would expect some of the features in the data such as family educational support and home internet access to be correlated and, further, conditionally dependent, naive bayes has been found to work well even with strong dependencies because these dependencies may either be equally distributed among the classes(labels) or cancel each other out.<sup>3</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "    The logit model is used by some Ad-Tech companies like M6D to estimate the probability of a user performing a desired action after being shown an ad (referred to as a conversion).  Specifically, it is used to sort a set of opportunities to bid in order of most likely to convert to least likely to convert.<sup>4</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Logistic regression works well when interpretability is desired because the effect of each of the attributes may be extracted and interpreted with respect to the impact on the odds of a positive signal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The drawback of logistic regression is that it requires large sample sizes and correlation among the expanatory variables can cause problems with estimation of parameters.<sup>5</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This model is particularly well suited for binary classification problems such as the one presented here.  I also chose it because it is scalable and interpretable.<sup>4</sup>  Not only could it help detect high-risk students but it may enable decision makers to hone in on the most important predictors of success or, conversely, of imminent danger of failure.  Such insights could inform future policy directly.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "    SVMs have been successfully applied to the problem of optical character recognition.  Speciffically, one-against-all multiclass SVM models have been applied to recognize \"the 10 numeral and 26 letters from Indian plates.\"<sup>6</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SVMs work well for binary classification problems, even with a small amounts of data.  Although a flaw in the opinion of some, SVMs give the user the flexibility to choose different kernels, which make them adaptable for data that may not be linearly separable.  SVMs are also know to be robust, that is, they provide good generalizability; this makes sense if one connsiders that the SVM algorithm maximizes the \"margin\" between the boundary and the data inherently. FInally, SVM's deliver globally optimal soultions because they rely on a convex optimization.<sup>7</sup> \n",
    "    \n",
    "    As alluded to above, the lack of a good guiding principle for choosing a kernel function is one of the drawbacks of SVM's.  Further, slow training and testing, and the extensive dmemory requirements of the quadratic programming have been cited as major drawbacks.<sup>8</sup>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SVM's are a good candiate for this problem because ththis is a binary classification problem for which there is a relatively small sample size of data avilable.  Algorithm complexity and memory demands may be an issue as the client seeks to keep costs to a minimum, however. \n",

    "For the task of identifying students at risk of failing I would recommend the use of a logistic regression.  Logistic regressions offer probabilistic interpretability and, though they often require larger samples to perform adequately, in this case the logistic regression outperformed the other candidate algorithms in our preliminary tests.  Logistic regressions also have the benefit of scaling well, which should allay any concerns about cost if this algorithm were to be applied to larger data sets.  Finally, the prediction time of the algorithm is low because determination of the class may be calculated using a small set of parameters. "

    "The logistic regression is a form of a linear model, much like one which you would create in excel to find the line of best fit for data points on a scatterplot, that is trained to predict the probability that a student will pass the final exam, given all the data we know about her.  Further, the logistic regression gives us a parameter for each of the attributes of the student, which can be used to calculate how each attribute impacts the students' odds of passing.  In order to make a final prediction, the model uses the parameters, or coefficients as they are known in this case, that the model has learned to compute a final probability of passing."

At this time, the algorithm would probably benefit more from more data than further parameter tuning.  That said, I would not expect the out of sample performance to improve much beyond an F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.82; based on the model's learning curve, whose source code I quickly adapted from the Boston Housing project, the testing and training scores are already starting to converge (see below)."
